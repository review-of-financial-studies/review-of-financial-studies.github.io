Authors should consult with a qualified party—such as university counsel or a lawyer—before selecting and applying a license.\nWe strongly encourage authors to adopt dual-use licenses that separately govern permissions for code and for data. This approach ensures clarity in how materials may be reused, adapted, and shared.\nFor code, scripts, programs, and software:\nFor data, databases, images, tables, text, and other non-code materials:\nBy applying appropriate licenses to both code and data, authors facilitate transparency, reproducibility, and responsible reuse, while retaining the ability to set clear boundaries on how their work may be employed."

The\nfollowing considerations are for informational purposes only, are not\nexhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n\n     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are\n     intended for use by those authorized to give the public\n     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by\n     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are\n     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms\n     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.\n     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\n     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the\n     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any\n     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-\n     licensed material, or material used under an exception or\n     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:\n    wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\n\n     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public\n     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the\n     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If\n     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for\n     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\n     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our\n     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\n     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n     the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n     reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,\n     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\n     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\n     respect those requests where reasonable.

To the\nextent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are\ngranted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of\nthese terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in\nconsideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the\nLicensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\n\nSection 1 -- Definitions.\n\n  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar\n     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material\n     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,\n     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring\n     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the\n     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\n     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\n     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\n     synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright\n     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in\n     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights\n     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,\n     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or\n     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights\n     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar\n     Rights.\n\n  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\n     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\n     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\n     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\n     agreements.\n\n  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,\n     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public\n     License.\n\n  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the\n     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to\n     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the\n     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\n  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\n     under this Public License.\n\n  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\n     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\n     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\n     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\n     available to the public including in ways that members of the\n     public may access the material from a place and at a time\n     individually chosen by them.\n\n  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright\n     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of\n     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,\n     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially\n     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n\n  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights\n     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n\nSection 2 -- Scope.\n\n  a. License grant.\n\n       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n               in part; and\n\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

Any requests for exemption from the CDSP must be made at the time of initial submission.\nOnboarding: All conditionally accepted manuscripts enter the data editing process. At this point, a DE will assess whether a CDSP review is required. If a review is needed, the DE will contact the corresponding author with further instructions. Otherwise, the handling editor will be notified. For common issues that arise during onboarding, please consult the FAQs.\nReview: Authors must prepare a replication package that complies with the CDSP and submit it via the RFS Dataverse. The package should be prepared for eventual public release and, therefore, must include pseudo or synthetic data in place of any non-public data. During the review phase, however, the package will remain private. Any issues encountered (e.g., execution errors or output discrepancies) will be resolved directly between the DE and the authors. The review process typically involves the following steps:\n\nThe DE configures a secure, dedicated virtual environment for the authors, based on the instructions in the README.\nThe DE verifies that the code executes successfully in this environment using the provided materials and may request revisions from the authors.\nOnce the code runs successfully, the DE invites the authors to the environment to upload all required raw data that cannot be shared publicly.\nThe DE verifies that the results reproduced in the authors’ environment match those reported in the submission.\nUpon successful verification, the DE releases the replication package on the RFS Dataverse and permanently and irrevocably deletes the virtual environment, along with any non-public data it contained.\n\nReport: The DE submits a report to the handling editor summarizing the outcome of the verification process. The report typically details which data were available for verification and which results were verified or updated during the process. If the replication package yields results that differ substantially from those reported in the manuscript, the handling editor will determine whether to proceed with or reverse the original editorial decision.\nAccept: The editor will then decide on the resubmitted final version of the manuscript. Upon final acceptance, authors may refer to their published replication package in the RFS Dataverse. At a later stage, the DE may choose to host the verified code and accompanying report in a public GitHub repository under the RFS organization.\n\n\nCommon Issues\nExperience from prior reviews indicates that a limited set of recurring issues accounts for most delays during the data editor process. Many of these delays can be avoided by ensuring that the replication package includes a README that follows the Social Science Data Editors template (version 1.1) for standardized documentation, as well as a LICENSE file that clearly specifies the terms governing the use of the code and data.\nBeyond these general requirements, the topics summarized below frequently arise during review and should ideally be addressed prior to submission:\n\n\n\nTopic\nStata\nPython\nR\n\n\n\n\nProject execution\nDo not use cd to change directories within scripts. Launch Stata from the project root (e.g., open main.do in the root or use a Stata project file).\nDo not use os.chdir(). Run code from the project root (e.g., uv run python main.py or runpy.run_path()), with all paths relative to the root.\nDo not use setwd(). Run R from the project root (e.g., open the folder directly in RStudio, Positron, or VS Code).\n\n\nFile paths & portability\nUse relative paths with forward slashes (/). Avoid backslashes (\\), which are Windows-specific.\nUse relative paths with forward slashes (/) or pathlib.Path. Avoid hard-coded absolute paths.\nUse relative paths with forward slashes (/). Do not rely on escaped backslashes (\\\\).\n\n\nDependency management\nDocument the Stata environment and required packages in setup.do (ado-path included).\nUse reproducible, cross-platform lockfiles (e.g., uv) rather than pip freeze-based requirements.txt.\nUse renv.lock to document and restore the R environment.\n\n\nExamples\nStata project template\nPython project template\nR project template"

    "text": "If you have any questions about the Code and Data Sharing Policy (CDSP) of the Review of Financial Studies (RFS) and its review process, please reach out to dataeditor@sfs.org.\n\nBefore manuscript submission\n\n\nWhen does the updated CDSP apply to my submission?\n\nThe updated CDSP applies to all submissions conditionally accepted on or after October 1, 2025. If your submission was conditionally accepted before this date, the policy does not apply. Submissions that are not conditionally accepted are not required to provide a replication package.\n\n\n\nI want to request an exemption from the CDSP. What should I do?\n\nAlthough authors are encouraged to apply appropriate licenses to limit reuse of their code and/or data, the CDSP allows for exemptions. Requests for full or partial exemptions must be made at the time of initial submission.\nAs outlined in the Guidelines for Submission, exemption requests must clearly state:\n\nWhich portions of the code and/or data you wish to withhold\n\nThe proposed duration of withholding\n\nThe justification for the request\n\nThe handling editor makes the final determination.\n\n\n\nDo I need to request exemptions for licensed data (e.g., CRSP or Compustat)?\n\nNo. You should not request exemptions for licensed, non-public data. Such data should not be included in the replication package.\n\n\n\nRegarding the replication package\n\n\nMy manuscript was conditionally accepted, but the editor requested further changes. Which version should the replication package reproduce?\n\nThe replication package must reproduce the results of the version that will ultimately be published. Accordingly, the package should reflect the version you plan to resubmit.\nIf your results have changed since the conditional acceptance, please provide the final manuscript version to the handling data editor when submitting your replication package.\n\n\n\nShould I upload proprietary data to the RFS Dataverse?\n\nNo. Proprietary data should not be uploaded to the RFS Dataverse.\nYour replication package should be prepared for eventual public release and may include:\n\nPseudo or synthetic data\n\nDetailed instructions enabling replication\n\nThe data editor will guide you through the process of securely sharing proprietary data for verification purposes only.\n\n\n\nMy submission uses regulatory or on-premise data. What should I do?\n\nClearly describe data availability in the README file and provide pseudo-data with the same structure as the original dataset.\n\n\n\nMay I include a README that does not conform to the template?\n\nThe standardized README template is intended to harmonize practices across journals and improve the author experience. Replication packages must conform to this standard, and data editors will request revisions until compliance is achieved.\n\n\n\nWhy does the RFS Dataverse default to the MIT license?\n\nThe MIT license was the most used license by authors. However, alternative licensing options are discussed on the License page, and the data editor can assist you in updating the license on the RFS Dataverse after submission.\nIf you do not use the RFS Dataverse template, the dataverse platform may default to a different license (e.g., CC0). You should update the license to reflect your intended terms of use.\n\n\n\nIf I submit to the RFS Dataverse, does my material become immediately public?\n\nNo. Replication packages are published only after approval by the data editors.\nDuring verification, you may update your materials. The final, approved version will be made public once the process is complete.\n\n\n\nCan I include the manuscript in the replication package?\n\nNo. Authors should not include the full manuscript in the replication package.\nReplication materials are typically distributed under open or permissive licenses (e.g., MIT or Modified BSD), which may conflict with publisher copyright and licensing requirements.\n\n\n\nHow long should I preserve confidential data after publication?\n\nWhile we do not impose an explicit minimum retention period for confidential data, authors are strongly encouraged to preserve such data for at least five years following publication. Authors should describe their data-retention and access arrangements in the paper’s README file, including any legal or contractual constraints on sharing or preservation.\n\n\n\nDuring verification\n\n\nMy submission was conditionally accepted. Do I need to resubmit to the editor as well as submit the replication package?\n\nThis depends on the editor’s decision letter:\n\nIf further revisions were requested, you must resubmit the revised manuscript to the editor and submit the replication package to the data editors.\nIf no further revisions were requested, you only need to submit the replication package to the data editors.\n\nThe editor makes the final acceptance decision.\n\n\n\nWhat should I do if I cannot meet the replication package deadline?\n\nContact the data editors as soon as possible and explain the reason for the delay. While the journal aims for a timely review process, reasonable deadline extensions may be granted.\n\n\n\nWho verifies that my code runs correctly?\n\nThe data editors are responsible for verification. They will:\n\nReview whether the documentation accurately describes the computational workflow\n\nExecute the code in a dedicated virtual computing environment\n\nConfirm that key tables and figures are reproduced\n\nSubmit a verification report to the handling editor\n\nAuthors work collaboratively with data editors throughout this process.\n\n\n\nWhat happens if there are technical issues during verification?\n\nIf technical issues arise, the data editors will contact you confidentially and request corrections before preparing their final report for the editor.\n\n\n\nWhat if the replication package produces different results than those reported in the manuscript?\n\nIf discrepancies arise, authors may update the replication package and consult the handling editor. The editor will determine whether to proceed with or reconsider the original editorial decision.\n\n\n\nAfter publication\n\n\nAm I expected to provide technical support to users of my replication package?\n\nNo. The CDSP explicitly states that “authors are not expected to provide assistance or ongoing support to users of the package.”\nYour responsibility is to supply a complete and well-documented replication package at the time of publication. Permissive licenses further clarify that materials are provided as is."
