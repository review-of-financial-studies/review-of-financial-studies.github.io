title: "Frequently Asked Questions"

If you have any questions about the [**Code and Data Sharing Policy**](https://sfs.org/review-of-financial-studies/code-sharing-policy/) (CDSP) of the *Review of Financial Studies* (RFS) and its review process, please reach out to <a href="mailto:dataeditor@sfs.org">dataeditor@sfs.org</a>.

### Before submission

<details>
<summary><strong>When does the updated CDSP apply to my submission?</strong></summary>

This policy applies to all submissions **conditionally accepted on or after October 1, 2025**. If your paper was conditionally accepted before this date, the policy does not apply. Papers that are not conditionally accepted do not have to provide replication packages.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>I want to request an exemption from the CDSP. What should I do?</strong></summary>

While we encourage you to apply an appropriate license to limit the reuse of your code and/or data, the CDSP allows for exemptions. If you want to be (partly) exempted from the CDSP for a certain period, you have to request the exemption **at the initial submission**. As detailed in the [Guidelines for Submission](https://sfs.org/guidelines-for-submissions/), the requst has to clearly indicate which portions of your code and/or data you wish to withhold, the duration of withholding, and the justification. Ultimately, the editor will decide on your request.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I have to ask for exemptions from sharing licensed data (e.g., CRSP or Compustat)?</strong></summary>

No. You should not request exemptions for licensed, non-public data. This data will not be included in the replication package.

</details>

### During the verification

<details>
<summary><strong>My paper was conditionally accepted but the editor requested further changes. Which version of the paper should be reproduced by the replication package?</strong></summary>

The replication package should reproduce the paper's results that will eventually be published. Hence, the package should reflect the version you will resubmit. 
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What should I do, if I cannot meet the deadline for submitting my replication package?</strong></summary>

Reach out to the data editors as soon as possible and explain the reasons for the delay. While the journal aims for a quick turnaround, there are valid reasons to extend the deadline.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Who verifies that my code actually works and what happens if there are technical issues?</strong></summary>

The data editors verify your replication package. They will:

- Check that your description of computational steps matches the submitted materials
- Run your code in a dedicated virtual computing environment
- Verify that your materials reproduce the paper's key tables and figures

You will work collaboratively with the data editors during this process. 
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What happens if there are technical issues in reproducing my results?</strong></summary>

If technical issues arise, the data editors will contact you directly in a confidential manner. You will be asked to correct the issues before the data editors prepare their final report for the handling editor.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What if the replication package produces different results than those reported in my paper?</strong></summary>

 If the replication package yields results that differ from those reported in the paper, the handling editor will decide whether to proceed with or reverse the original editorial decision. 
</details>


### After publication

<details>
<summary><strong>Am I expected to provide technical support to other researchers who use my replication package after publication?</strong></summary>

No. The policy explicitly states that *"Authors are not expected to provide assistance or ongoing support to users of the Package"*. Your obligation is to provide a complete, well-documented package at the time of publication, but you have no ongoing support responsibilities.
