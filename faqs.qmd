If you have any questions about the [**Code and Data Sharing Policy**](https://sfs.org/review-of-financial-studies/code-sharing-policy/) (CDSP) of the *Review of Financial Studies* (RFS) and its review process, please reach out to <a href="mailto:dataeditor@sfs.org">dataeditor@sfs.org</a>.

### Before manuscript submission

<details>
<summary>When does the updated CDSP apply to my submission?</summary>

The updated CDSP applies to all submissions **conditionally accepted on or after October&nbsp;1, 2025**. If your submission was conditionally accepted before this date, the policy does not apply. Submissions that are not conditionally accepted are **not required** to provide a replication package.

</details>

<details>
<summary>I want to request an **exemption** from the CDSP. What should I do?</summary>

Although authors are encouraged to apply appropriate licenses to limit reuse of their code and/or data, the CDSP allows for exemptions. Requests for full or partial exemptions must be made **at the time of initial submission**.

As outlined in the *Guidelines for Submission*, exemption requests must clearly state:

- Which portions of the code and/or data you wish to withhold  
- The proposed duration of withholding  
- The justification for the request  

The handling editor makes the final determination.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Do I need to request exemptions for **licensed data** (e.g., CRSP or Compustat)?</summary>

No. You should **not** request exemptions for licensed, non-public data. Such data should not be included in the replication package.

</details>

### Regarding the replication package

<details>
<summary>My manuscript was conditionally accepted, but the editor requested further changes. Which version should the replication package reproduce?</summary>

The replication package must reproduce the results of the version that will ultimately be published.  Accordingly, the package should reflect the version you plan to resubmit.

If your results have changed since the conditional acceptance, please provide the final manuscript version to the handling data editor when submitting your replication package.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Should I upload **proprietary data** to the RFS Dataverse?</summary>

No. Proprietary data should **not** be uploaded to the RFS Dataverse.

Your replication package should be prepared for eventual public release and may include:

- Pseudo or synthetic data  
- Detailed instructions enabling replication  

The data editor will guide you through the process of securely sharing proprietary data for verification purposes only.

</details>

<details>
<summary>My submission uses **regulatory** or **on-premise data**. What should I do?</summary>

Clearly describe data availability in the README file and provide pseudo-data with the same structure as the original dataset.

</details>

<details>
<summary>May I include a README that does not conform to the template?</summary>

The standardized README template is intended to harmonize practices across journals and improve the author experience. Replication packages must conform to this standard, and data editors will request revisions until compliance is achieved.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why does the RFS Dataverse default to the **CC0 license**?</summary>

The default license cannot be changed at the time of submission. However, alternative licensing options are discussed on the [License](license.qmd) page, and the data editor can assist you in updating the license on the RFS Dataverse after submission.

</details>

<details>
<summary>If I submit to the RFS Dataverse, does my material become immediately **public**?</summary>

No. Replication packages are published **only after approval** by the data editors.

During verification, you may update your materials. The final, approved version will be made public once the process is complete.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I include the **manuscript** in the replication package?</summary>

No. Authors should not include the full manuscript in the replication package.

Replication materials are typically distributed under open or permissive licenses (e.g., MIT or Modified BSD), which may conflict with publisher copyright and licensing requirements.

</details>

### During verification

<details>
<summary>My submission was conditionally accepted. Do I need to resubmit to the editor as well as submit the replication package?</summary>

This depends on the editor’s decision letter:

1. If further revisions were requested, you must **resubmit the revised manuscript to the editor** and **submit the replication package to the data editors**.
2. If no further revisions were requested, you only need to **submit the replication package to the data editors**.

The editor makes the final acceptance decision.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What should I do if I cannot meet the **replication package deadline**?</summary>

Contact the data editors as soon as possible and explain the reason for the delay. While the journal aims for a timely review process, reasonable deadline extensions may be granted.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Who verifies that my code runs correctly?</summary>

The data editors are responsible for verification. They will:

- Review whether the documentation accurately describes the computational workflow  
- Execute the code in a dedicated virtual computing environment  
- Confirm that key tables and figures are reproduced  
- Submit a verification report to the handling editor  

Authors work collaboratively with data editors throughout this process.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What happens if there are **technical issues** during verification?</summary>

If technical issues arise, the data editors will contact you confidentially and request corrections before preparing their final report for the editor.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What if the replication package produces **different results** than those reported in the manuscript?</summary>

If discrepancies arise, authors may update the replication package and consult the handling editor. The editor will determine whether to proceed with or reconsider the original editorial decision.

</details>


### After publication

<details>
<summary>Am I expected to provide **technical support** to users of my replication package?</summary>

No. The CDSP explicitly states that *“authors are not expected to provide assistance or ongoing support to users of the package.”*

Your responsibility is to supply a complete and well-documented replication package at the time of publication. [Permissive licenses](license.qmd) further clarify that materials are provided *as is*.
