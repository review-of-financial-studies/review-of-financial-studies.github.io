If you have any questions about the [**Code and Data Sharing Policy**](https://sfs.org/review-of-financial-studies/code-sharing-policy/) (CDSP) of the *Review of Financial Studies* (RFS) and its review process, please reach out to <a href="mailto:dataeditor@sfs.org">dataeditor@sfs.org</a>.

### Before paper submission

<details>
<summary>When does the updated CDSP apply to my submission?</summary>

This policy applies to all submissions **conditionally accepted on or after October 1, 2025**. If your paper was conditionally accepted before this date, the policy does not apply. Papers that are not conditionally accepted do not have to provide replication packages.

</details>

<details>
<summary>I want to request an **exemption** from the CDSP. What should I do?</summary>

While we encourage you to apply an appropriate license to limit the reuse of your code and/or data, the CDSP allows for exemptions. If you want to be (partly) exempted from the CDSP for a certain period, you have to request the exemption **at the initial submission**. As detailed in the [Guidelines for Submission](https://sfs.org/guidelines-for-submissions/), the request has to clearly indicate which portions of your code and/or data you wish to withhold, the duration of withholding, and the justification. Ultimately, the editor will decide on your request.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Do I have to ask for **exemptions** from sharing **licensed data** (e.g., CRSP or Compustat)?</summary>

No. You should not request exemptions for licensed, non-public data. This data will not be included in the replication package.

</details>

### Regarding the package

<details>
<summary>My paper was conditionally accepted, but the editor requested **further changes**. Which version of the paper should be reproduced using the replication package?</summary>

The replication package should reproduce the paper's results that will eventually be published. Hence, the package should reflect the version you will resubmit. 
</details>

<details>
<summary>Should I upload **proprietary data** to the RFS dataverse?</summary>

No. You should *not* add proprietary data to the RFS dataverse when submitting your package to the data editors. Any material uploaded to the RFS dataverse could be published after the replication package is accepted.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I also add a README that does not conform to the template [README](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/)?</summary>

The idea of the template for the [README](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/) is a standardization of the process across journals, which aims at improving the author experience. Hence, the data editors will ask you for an update until you conform to the standards.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why does the RFS Dataverse default to the **CC0 license**?</summary>

We cannot change the default. However, we provide some alternative suggestions on our [License page](license.qmd). You can update the license later on.
</details>

<details>
<summary>If I submit to the RFS Dataverse, does my material become immediately **public**?</summary>

No. The data editors have to publish all replication packages. During the verification process, you can update the package. Then, the final version will be published after it is approved by the data editors.
</details>

<details>
<summary>
Can I include the **manuscript** of my submission in the replication package?
</summary>
No. Authors should not include the full text of their paper in the replication package. Replication packages are typically distributed under an open-source or highly permissive license (e.g., MIT, Modified BDS), which often conflicts with the copyright and licensing terms required by the publisher.
</details>

### During the verification

<details>
<summary>My paper has been conditionally accepted, should I just submit the replication package to the data editors or do I have to resubmit to the editor as well?</summary>

The answer to this question depends: 

(1) If the editor made further revision requests in their decision letter, you have to resubmit to the editor. Additionally, you have to submit your replication package to the data editors.
(2) If the editor did not make further requests, you only have to submit the replication package to the data editors. 

In the end, the editor makes the final acceptance decision.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What should I do, if I cannot meet the **deadline** for submitting my replication package?</summary>

Reach out to the data editors as soon as possible and explain the reasons for the delay. While the journal aims for a quick turnaround, there are valid reasons to extend the deadline.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Who verifies that my code actually works?</summary>

The data editors verify your replication package. They will:

- Check that your description of computational steps matches the submitted materials
- Run your code in a dedicated virtual computing environment
- Verify that your materials reproduce the paper's key tables and figures
- Submit a report to the editor, who will decide on final acceptance 

You will work collaboratively with the data editors during this process. 
</details>

<details>
<summary>What happens if there are **technical issues** in reproducing my results?</summary>

If technical issues arise, the data editors will contact you directly in a confidential manner. You will be asked to correct the issues before the data editors prepare their final report for the handling editor.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What if the replication package produces **different results** than those reported in my paper?</summary>

If the replication package yields results that differ from those reported in the paper, the handling editor will decide whether to proceed with or reverse the original editorial decision. 
</details>


### After publication

<details>
<summary>Am I expected to provide **technical support** to other researchers who use my replication package after publication?</summary>

No. The policy explicitly states that *"Authors are not expected to provide assistance or ongoing support to users of the Package"*. Your obligation is to provide a complete, well-documented package at the time of publication, but you have no ongoing support responsibilities. Moreover, licenses such as [MIT or Modified BSD](license.qmd) further clarify that the code is provided *as is*.
